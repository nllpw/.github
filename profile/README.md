# Natural Legal Language Processing (NLLP)

NLLP aims to bring researchers and practitioners from NLP, machine learning and other artificial intelligence disciplines together with legal practitioners and researchers.

## NLLP Workshop 

Following the success of the first three editions of the NLLP workshop (NAACL 2019, KDD 2020, EMNLP 2021), we aim to bring researchers and practitioners from NLP, machine learning and other artificial intelligence disciplines together with legal practitioners and researchers. We welcome submissions describing original work on legal data, as well as data with legal relevance. NLLP Workshop 2022 will take place on Thursday 8 December 2022 in Abu Dhabi, UAE, co-located with EMNLP 2022.

## NLLP Talks

The NLLP Talks series brings together researchers from academia and industry working at the intersection of law and NLP. The talks explore in depth recent research in this multidisciplinary space. By featuring presenters and discussants from complementary disciplines, the NLLP Talks series aims to further bridge law and computational linguistics.
